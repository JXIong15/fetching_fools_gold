## Description
A Selenium-Python based algorithm to find the fake gold bar in the minimum number of weighings.
* **GitHub:** https://github.com/JXIong15/fetching_fools_gold
* **Tested Website:** http://sdetchallenge.fetchrewards.com/
<p><img src="" width="100%"  stylealt="tested website page"/></p>
<p align="center">(The SDET Challenge webpage to be tested using Selenium)</p>


## Installations
* **ChromeDriver** Installation
    * To check/update Chrome, go to the menu and select `Help > About Google Chrome` or download and install it: https://www.google.com/chrome/
    * Next, download the matching version of ChromeDriver: https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/
    * Lastly, add it to your system path
        * You can figure out your PATH by typing `echo $PATH` in your `command line`
    * To make sure chromedriver is working, type `chromedriver` in your `command line`. You should receive the same message in the image below:

* Clone *this* repo in *command line*: `git clone` and one of the links below
  * **HTTPS:** https://github.com/JXIong15/fetching_fools_gold.git
  * **SSH:** git@github.com:JXIong15/fetching_fools_gold.git
* `cd` into the project and install in your command line:
  * *python*: https://www.python.org/downloads/
  * *pip*: should automatically be installed with python above
  * *pipenv*: https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/install/
    * run `pipenv install` to download provided packages to pipfile and project
    * run `pipenv shell` to enter the virtual environment


## Functionality
* For the purpose of this project, the environmental variables are given in `.env.EXAMPLE`. 
Delete the **.EXAMPLE** part to use the **.env** file
* It is recommended that you create your own superuser to access the Django Admin: `python manage.py createsuperuser`
* To start the app locally, run `python manage.py runserver` and go to `http://localhost:8000/admin`
  * there is currently no Frontend, so you will just see the Django Admin panel with its built-in forms
* Using **Postman** (or any similar application):
  * GET *http://localhost:8000/balance/* : returns a list of the current payer balances
  * GET *http://localhost:8000/payer/* : returns a list of the current payers
  * GET *http://localhost:8000/transaction/* : returns a list of the transactions from oldest timestamp
  * POST *http://localhost:8000/payer/* : data = `{'name'='NAME'}` will return the new payer's information
  * POST *http://localhost:8000/transaction/* : data = `{'name'='NAME', 'points'=int, timestamp=time}` will add the 
new points to the specified payer
  * POST *http://localhost:8000/spend/* : data = `{'points'=int}` will return a receipt of which payer(s) spent points 
and how many points each payer spent
    * points are spent in order of oldest transaction timestamp
  * DELETE *http://localhost:8000/payer/{payer_id}* : will delete the payer and all associated transactions to them


## Commands
* In the *virtual environment*, run:
  * Server: `python manage.py runserver`
  * Tests: `python manage.py test`
  * Webclient Requests: `python points/client.py`


## Technologies Used
* **Django** and **Django REST Framework**
* **Postman** to test API routes: https://www.postman.com/downloads/
* **environ** for secret keys
* **requests** for Python web client


## Results
* **Webclient Results**:

* **Test Results**:
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/72YEB2F.png" width="100%" height="100%" stylealt="tests results"/></p>


## Future Ideas
* In *tests*, get `object.create()` to work so that the code efficiently runs
  * right now it makes API calls to `post` new objects
* Figure out how to connect Transaction and Payer models by Payer name rather than foreign key
* Get Django forms and Django Admin to function properly when transactions are ran. Currently, calling the API routes is the only way transaction points are applied to payers.

Download selebium
Make sure to download chromedriver for your version of chrome
download chromedriver (I used Homebrew) and add to PATH 
can find PATH using "echo $PATH" in terminal
check chromedriver works by running "chromedriver" in terminal
if getting an Apple error for chromedriver, go to directory where chromedriver is and run "xattr -d com.apple.quarantine chromedriver"

CD into directory of project and type python3 main.py
